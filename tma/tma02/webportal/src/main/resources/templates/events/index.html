1. Implement the view to list all events in a table. The view must be embedded by the layout.html.
Each rows must show the event code, name, description, status and event date.
Each rows must also provide links to edit and delete the event by passing event id as the path variable.

You can refer to that of items/index.html for a similar implementation.
